## Dataset overview

The cleaned NYC Transit Subway Entrance and Exit dataset contains
information about entrances and exits of subway stations in New York
City. Variables selected for inclusion in the cleaned dataset imported
into R include the line, station name, location coordinates (latitude
and longitude), routes served (route 1 through to route 11), entry,
vending presence, entrance type, and ADA compliance.

The data cleaning process involved reading the CSV file from a local
subdirectory /data, cleaning variable names using the janitor package,
selecting variables of interest, and converting the ‘entry’ variable
from character (“YES”/“NO”) to logical (TRUE/FALSE).

The resulting dataset has **1868 rows** and **19 columns**. The dataset
is not tidy because information about routes served is spread across
multiple columns (Route1 through Route11). This does not align with good
tidy data practice, as each variable should form a column and each
observation should form a row.
