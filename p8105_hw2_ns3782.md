## Dataset overview

The cleaned NYC Transit Subway Entrance and Exit dataset contains
information about entrances and exits of subway stations in New York
City. Variables selected for inclusion in the cleaned dataset imported
into R include the line, station name, location coordinates (latitude
and longitude), routes served (route 1 through to route 11), entry,
vending presence, entrance type, and ADA compliance.

The data cleaning process involved reading the CSV file from a local
subdirectory /data, cleaning variable names using the janitor package,
selecting variables of interest, and converting the ‘entry’ variable
from character (“YES”/“NO”) to logical (TRUE/FALSE).

The resulting dataset has **1868 rows** and **19 columns**. The dataset
is not tidy because information about routes served is spread across
multiple columns (Route1 through Route11). This does not align with good
tidy data practice, as each variable should form a column and each
observation should form a row.

## How many distinct stations are there?

``` r
nyc_transit_df %>%
  distinct(station_name, line) %>%
  nrow()
```

    ## [1] 465

There are 465 distinct subway stations in the NYC transit subway system.

## How many stations are ADA compliant?

``` r
nyc_transit_df %>%
  filter(ada == TRUE) %>%
  distinct(station_name, line) %>%
  nrow()
```

    ## [1] 84

There are 84 ADA compliant stations.

## What proportion of station entrances / exits without vending allow entrance?

``` r
prop_no_vending_entry <- nyc_transit_df %>%
  filter(vending == "NO") %>%
  summarise(prop = mean(entry, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  pull(prop)
```

The proportion of station entrances/exits without vending that allow
entrance is 0.3770492, or 37.7%.

## Read and clean Gwynnda Wheel sheet

gwynnda_trash_wheel_df <- read_excel(

## Combine all trash wheel datasets
combined_trash_wheel <- bind_rows(
  mr_trash_wheel_df, 
  prof_trash_wheel_df, 
  gwynnda_trash_wheel_df

  select(trash_wheel, everything())

# Total weight collected by Prof Trash Wheel
prof_total_weight <- prof_trash_wheel_df %>%
  summarize(total_weight = sum(weight_tons)) %>%
  pull(total_weight)

# Total cigarette butts collected by Gwynnda June 2022
gwynnda_june_2022_butts <- gwynnda_trash_wheel_df %>%
  filter(month == "June", year == 2022) %>%
  summarize(total_butts = sum(cigarette_butts)) %>%
  pull(total_butts)
```

## Combined trash wheel Dataset Overview

The combined Trash Wheel dataset contains 845 observations and 15
variables. Key variables include the identifier for each trash wheel
(Mr. Trash Wheel, Professor Trash Wheel, Gwynnda Trash Wheel), the date
of collection, the amount of trash collected (in tons and cubic yards),
types of litter collected (e.g., plastic bottles, polystyrene, cigarette
butts), and number of homes powered based on trash collected.

The data shows that Professor Trash Wheel has collected a total of
216.26 tons of trash since its deployment. In June 2022, Gwynnda Trash
Wheel collected 18,120 cigarette butts.
